# Learning Summary â€“ Week 03

In Week 03, I practiced provisioning a resource group using Terraform. I reused the configuration from Week 02, changed the resource name, and applied it successfully.

### What I learned:
- How to avoid mistakes with folder structure (e.g. nested week03 folders)
- Importance of running Terraform commands from the correct directory
- That `.tfstate` files track real infrastructure state and should not be edited manually
- How to push clean Terraform code to GitHub without committing `.terraform` or `.tfstate` files
