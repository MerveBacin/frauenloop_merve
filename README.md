# ☁️ Cloud Engineering Journey – FrauenLoop (12 Weeks)

Welcome to my cloud engineering learning journey! This repository documents my weekly progress in the **FrauenLoop Cloud Engineering Cycle II** program. Over 12 weeks, I will explore key cloud technologies, tools, and concepts — with a strong focus on **Terraform**, **Azure**, **infrastructure as code (IaC)**, and **DevOps practices**.
