# Learning Summary â€“ Week 04

In this week, I learned how to provision Azure Storage Accounts and Blob Containers with Terraform. I practiced:

- Using the `random_string` resource for unique naming
- Linking resources (storage account and container)
- Managing resource dependencies in Terraform

This builds on my knowledge from previous weeks and expands my Terraform skills.
