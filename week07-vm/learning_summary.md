# Learning Summary â€“ Week 07

## What I learned

- How to provision a Linux virtual machine on Azure using Terraform.
- How to configure SSH key-based authentication in the VM.
- The structure and dependencies of Azure resources like:
  - Virtual network
  - Subnet
  - Network interface
  - Virtual machine
- How to securely manage private and public SSH keys.

## Challenges I faced

- Ensuring the correct SSH key path and format were used.
- Understanding the dependency flow between subnet, NIC, and VM.
- Remembering to disable password authentication for added security.

## Key Takeaway

Provisioning infrastructure using Terraform is powerful, but requires clear planning of how resources are connected. Automating secure VM access using SSH keys is an essential DevOps skill.
